Project Title: Athlete Data Processing Library

Description: Developed a robust and efficient JavaScript/TypeScript library designed to process and validate data from professional athletes' sports computers. The library is capable of loading multiple data types—activity summaries, laps, and samples—and consolidating them into a unified JSON format for analysis by scientific teams.

Key Features:

Activity Summary Loader: Implements a method to load and validate detailed activity summary data, ensuring all required fields are present and correctly formatted.
Data Validation: Employs strict validation rules to prevent processing of incomplete or invalid data, throwing meaningful error messages to guide user corrections.
Typescript Integration: Utilizes TypeScript for type safety and enhanced development experience, ensuring that the structure of data is adhered to across the application.
Test Coverage: Achieved over 80% test coverage using Jest, ensuring the reliability and correctness of library functionality. The library includes unit tests that cover various scenarios, including normal, empty, and partial data inputs.
Modular Architecture: Designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy extension and maintenance. The library can be integrated into larger applications or used as a standalone tool.
Error Handling: Implements comprehensive error handling mechanisms to provide users with clear feedback on issues related to data validation and processing.
Technical Stack:

Language: TypeScript
Testing Framework: Jest
Package Management: npm
Development Environment: Node.js
Usage Example:

typescript
Copy code
import { DataLoader } from './DataLoader';
import { ActivitySummary } from './types';

const loader = new DataLoader();
const activityData: ActivitySummary = {
userId: "123",
activityId: 1,
activityName: "Running",
durationInSeconds: 3600,
startTimeInSeconds: 1609459200,
startTimeOffsetInSeconds: 0,
activityType: "Running",
averageHeartRateInBeatsPerMinute: 140,
activeKilocalories: 800,
deviceName: "Garmin",
maxHeartRateInBeatsPerMinute: 180
};

try {
const validatedData = loader.loadActivitySummary(activityData);
console.log('Validated Activity Data:', validatedData);
} catch (error) {
console.error('Error loading activity data:', error.message);
}
Conclusion: This library serves as an essential tool for researchers and developers working with athlete data, providing a structured and reliable method for processing activity information. By ensuring data integrity and offering a flexible API, the library facilitates in-depth analysis and insights into athletic performance.
